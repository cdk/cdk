/**
 * Finds the Set of all Rings. This is an implementation of the algorithm
 * published in {@cdk.cite HAN96}. Some of the comments refer to pseudo code
 * fragments listed in this article. The concept is that a regular molecular
 * graph is first converted into a path graph (refer PathGraph.java),
 * i.e. a graph where the edges are actually paths. This can list several
 * nodes that are implicitly connecting the two nodes between the path
 * is formed (refer PathEdge.java).
 *
 * The paths that join source and sink node are step by step fused and the joined
 * nodes are deleted from the path graph (collapsed path). What remains is a graph
 * of paths that have the same start and endpoint and are thus rings (source=sink=ring).
