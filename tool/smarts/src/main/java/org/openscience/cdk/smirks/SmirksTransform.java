/**
 * A SMIRKS transform, is a {@link Transform} which can optionally (on by
 * default) perform ring and aromaticity (Daylight) perception. Before applying
 * the transform the molecule is matched it is passed to
 * {@link SmartsPattern#prepare}. The prepare function ensures ring and aromatic
 * flags are consistent. You can turn off by setting {@link #setPrepare(boolean)} to
 * false.
