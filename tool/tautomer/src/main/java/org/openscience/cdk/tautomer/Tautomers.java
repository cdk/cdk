/**
 * Efficient generate tautomers using the Sayle-Delany algorithm <a href="https://www.daylight.com/meetings/emug99/Delany/taut_html/index.htm">Sayle 96,
 * Canonicalization and Enumeration of Tautomers</a>. The algorithm uses
 * simple rules to identify atoms which can either accept, donate or transfer
 * a proton. These atoms are then partitioned into a different components/zones
 * and the hydrogens/bond orders stripped. The hydrogens are then placed using
 * backtracking algorithm failing whenever an invalid Kekul√© state is found.
 * <br/>
 * This algorithm is very efficient and can process hundreds of thousands of
 * molecules per second. Typically, it is quicker to generate the tautomers then
 * store and read them back in but it's up to the caller to decide how to use it.
 *
 * <h1>Prerequisites/Limitations:</h1>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Implicit hydrogens should be assigned and suppressed, explicit
 *     hydrogens (and their isotopes) can not be shifted.</li>
 *     <li>Ring membership should be assigned ({@link Cycles#markRingAtomsAndBonds}), this is mainly required
 *     for keto-enol tautomers where protons try to avoid carbon's in rings</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1>Side-effects:</h1>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The input molecule is modified in place, aromaticity flags are
 *         cleared and the hydrogen count/bond orders will change. The generator
 *         returns the same molecule on each iteration and so if copies need to be
 *         kept a {@link IAtomContainer#clone()}
 *         should be used on input and output.</li>
 * </ul>
