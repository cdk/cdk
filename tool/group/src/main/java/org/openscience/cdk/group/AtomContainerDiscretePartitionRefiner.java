/**
 * A tool for determining the automorphism group of the atoms in a molecule, or for checking for a
 * canonical form of a molecule.
 *
 * <p>If two atoms are equivalent under an automorphism in the group, then roughly speaking they are
 * in symmetric positions in the molecule. For example, the C atoms in two methyl groups attached to
 * a benzene ring are 'equivalent' in this sense.
 *
 * <p>There are a couple of ways to use it - firstly, get the automorphisms.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     IAtomContainer ac = ... // get an atom container somehow
 *     AtomContainerDiscretePartitionRefiner refiner =
 *          PartitionRefinement.forAtoms().create()
 *     PermutationGroup autG = refiner.getAutomorphismGroup(ac);
 *     for (Permutation automorphism : autG.all()) {
 *         ... // do something with the permutation
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Another is to check an atom container to see if it is canonical:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     IAtomContainer ac = ... // get an atom container somehow
 *     AtomContainerDiscretePartitionRefiner refiner =
 *          PartitionRefinement.forAtoms().create()
 *     if (refiner.isCanonical(ac)) {
 *         ... // do something with the atom container
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that it is not necessary to call {@link #refine(IAtomContainer)} before either of these
 * methods. However if both the group and the canonical check are required, then the code should be:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     AtomContainerDiscretePartitionRefiner refiner =
 *          PartitionRefinement.forAtoms().create()
 *     refiner.refine(ac);
 *     boolean isCanon = refiner.isCanonical();
 *     PermutationGroup autG = refiner.getAutomorphismGroup();
 * </pre>
 *
 * This way, the refinement is not carried out multiple times.
