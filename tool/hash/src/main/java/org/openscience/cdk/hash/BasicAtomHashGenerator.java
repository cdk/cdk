/**
 * A generator for basic atom hash codes. This implementation is based on the
 * description by {@cdk.cite Ihlenfeldt93}. The hash codes use an initial
 * generator to seed the values of each atom. The initial values are then
 * combined over a series of cycles up to a specified depth. At each cycle the
 * hash values of adjacent invariants are incorporated.
 *
 * <h4>Which depth should I use?</h4> The <i>depth</i> determines the number of
 * cycles and thus how <i>deep</i> the hashing is, larger values discriminate
 * more molecules but can take longer to compute. The original publication
 * recommends a depth of 32 however values as low as 6 can yield good results.
 * The actual depth required is related to the <i>diameter</i> of the chemical
 * graph. The <i>diameter</i> is the longest shortest path, that is, the
 * furthest distance one must travel between any two vertex. Unfortunately the
 * time complexity of finding the longest shortest path in an undirected graph
 * is O(n<sup>2</sup>) which is larger then the time required for this hash
 * function. Depending on the types of molecules in your data set the depth
 * should be adjusted accordingly. For example, a library of large-lipids would
 * require deeper hashing to discriminate differences in chain length.
 *
 * <h4>Usage</h4>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * SeedGenerator     seeding   = ...
 * AtomHashGenerator generator = new BasicAtomHashGenerator(seeding,
 *                                                          new Xorshift(),
 *                                                          32);
 *
 * IAtomContainer benzene = MoleculeFactory.benzene();
 * long[]         hashes  = generator.generate(benzene);
