JavaNCSS - A Source Measurement Suite for Java</H1></CENTER>

&nbsp;
<BR>Ever wondered how many lines of code or how many classes there are
in&nbsp; the Sun JDK? Curious about the size of your own projects - or
do you want to keep track of your work-progress. That's what JavaNCSS is
for.

<P>JavaNCSS is a simple command line utility which measures two standard
source code metrics for the Java programming language. The metrics are
collected globally, for each class and/or for each function.

<P>Here is an example about what JavaNCSS prints out for the Sun JDK 1.1.5
<A HREF="package.txt">java.*</A> source tree.

<p>JavaNCSS can optionally present its output with a little
<a href="gui.html">graphical user interface</a>. To interactively select Java source
files for counting, <a href="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/jacob/">Jacob</a> (a Java class browser and project
manager) can be used for this purpose.

<P>You can always find the newest version of this page at: <A HREF="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/java/javancss/">http://www.kclee.com/clemens/java/javancss/</A>

<h4>
Downloading Java Development Kit and Swing</h4>

<P>JavaNCSS requires the Java Developer's Kit (JDK) Version 1.1.6 or above. Since you already seem to have Java source code
you want to measure, I assume you already have a JDK :).
If not, you can download it
via web from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/nav/download/index.html">Javasoft</A>.
Follow the link to "JDK 1.1" and download the version applicable to your
environment.

<p>You don't need Swing if you simply want to use JavaNCSS in
command line (batch) mode.
<P>Swing is a part of the Java Foundation
Class library which will be part of the next JDK 1.2. Swing can be downloaded
from Javasoft's <A HREF="http://developer.javasoft.com/servlet/SessionServlet?action=showLogin&url=/developer/earlyAccess/">Developer
Connection</A> (requires membership). If you don't have a password yet,
you can get it for free there.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<A NAME="usage"></A>Usage</H2>
Make sure <tt>javancss17.37/lib/javancss.jar</tt>, <tt>javancss17.37/lib/ccl.jar</tt>, and <tt>javancss17.37/lib/ jhbasic.jar</tt> are added to your CLASSPATH.
<p>
Then to start JavaNCSS type: <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">java javancss.Main</FONT></TT>.
As an alternative you can edit and use either the <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><tt>JAVANCSS.BAT</tt></FONT>
or <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">javancss</FONT></TT> file. Just change the
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">JAVA_HOME</FONT></TT> and <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><tt>CLASSPATH</tt></FONT>
variables according to your system. Make sure you did include the swingall.jar archive in the classpath.
<p>
Now for the first run type in (beeing in the <tt>javancss17.37</tt> directory itself):
<p>
<tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">./bin/javancss -gui test/*.java</FONT></TT>
<p>
or
<p>
<tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">./bin/javancss -gui -recursive test</FONT></TT>
<p>
For regression test of JavaNCSS use:
<p>
<tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">java javancss.test.JavancssTest</FONT></TT> 
<p>If no parameter is provided for JavaNCSS, standard
input (stdin) is used as the input stream. Multiple java source files can
be specified in the command line. If a '@' char is put in front of a file name, then not this file will be measured but its content will be interpreted as a list of Java source files that
shall be counted. The '@' functionality can be used recursively inside this file as well. Wild cards are not supported yet. (If
the operating system processes the command line for the program, then you
are lucky. Windows doesn't do that.) Instead use something like <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">cat
*.java | javancss</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">type *.java
| javancss</FONT></TT>. Of course, this can lead to ambiguities when mixing
source files that belong to a package with files that doesn't.
<p> If no option
is given, JavaNCSS only calculates the total non commenting source statements
(NCSS) of the given input.

<h3>XSLT Stylesheet</h3>

JavaNCSS comes with an XSLT stylesheet (<tt>javancss17.37/xslt/javancss2text.xsl</tt>). This stylesheet can be used to
convert XML output from JavaNCSS to ASCII output. This is of course
quite boring and much slower as JavaNCSS creates the identical output
by default anyway. But you can use this stylesheet as a starting
point to have your own presentation format or to create HTML
pages. You could also change sort rules (e.g. sort by NCSS)
or add your own filters to the output (e.g. show only methods
with NCSS greater some limit).<p>

Assuming you have e.g. Xalan2 installed and somewhere in your
path is a shell script named 'xslt' that knows how to invoke
Java with the Xalan 2 main processor class (org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process),
here is how you can make use of JavaNCSS' XSLT stylesheet:<p>
<tt>cd javancss17.37</tt><br>
<tt>javancss -all -xml -recursive src > example.xml</tt><br>
<tt>xslt -in example.xml -xsl xslt/javancss2text.xsl</tt><p>
Have fun. If you create a useful new stylesheet for JavaNCSS,
I would be happy to get a copy of it.

<H3>
Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS)</H3>
Statements for JavaNCSS are not statements as specified in the Java Language
Specification but include all kinds of declarations too.
<BR>Roughly spoken, NCSS is approximately equivalent to counting ';' and
'{' characters in Java source files.

<P>Actually, the NCSS counter gets incremented by one for each:

&nbsp;<br>
Not counted are empty statements, empty blocks or semicolons after closing
brackets. Of course, comments don't get counted too. Closing brackets also
never get counted, the same applies to blocks in general.

<P>In some cases consecutive semicolons are illegal according to the JLS
but JavaNCSS still tolerates them (thought JavaNCSS is still more strict
as 'javac'). Nevertheless they are never counted as two statements.
<H3>
Cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN)</H3>
CCN is also know as McCabe Metric. There exists a much hyped theory behind
it based on graph theory, but it all comes down to simply counting 'if',
'for', 'while' statements etc. in a method. Whenever the control flow of
a method splits, the "CCN counter" gets incremented by one.

<P>Each method has a minimum value of 1 per default. For each of the following
Java keywords/statements this value gets incremented by one:
<UL>
<LI>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">if</FONT></TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">for</FONT></TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">while</FONT></TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">case</FONT></TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">catch</FONT></TT></LI>
</UL>
Also if the control flow of a method returns abortively the <tt>CCN</tt> value will
be incremented by one:
<UL>
<li>
<tt><font color="FFFFFF">return</font></tt></li>
<li><tt><font color="FFFFFF">throw</font></tt></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br>
An ordinary return at the end of method (no matter if it's a function or a procedure)
will not be counted.
<p>
Note that <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">else</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">default</FONT></TT>,
and <TT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">finally</FONT></TT> don't increment the CCN
value any further. On the other hand, a simple method with a <tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">switch</font></tt> statement
and a huge block of <tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">case</font></tt> statements can have a surprisingly high CCN value (still it has the same value when converting a <tt><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">switch</font></tt>
block to an equivalent sequence of <tt><font color="FFFFFF">if</font></tt> statements).

<P>The first article about this trivial software metric is one of the most
cited papers in computer science. Sometimes you just must be the first
to point out some basic shit and you are history. It seems just like a
wonder that nobody was able to package Lines of Code in a more scientific
manner. Now it's too late to label someone's name on it :).

<H3>
Version 17.37</H3>

Version 17.37 has been released on May 4, 2002<p>Javadocs metric on package level and example XSLT stylesheet.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>Javadocs are now also displayed on a package level thanks
   to a patch by Emilio Gongora and Guillermo Rodriguez.
</li><li>XSLT stylesheet to convert XML output to ascii output.
   This is identical to the output you could get directly from
   JavaNCSS and much slower, but can be used as a basis for your
   own output format or to produce HTML output instead text.
</li></ol><h4>Fixed Bugs</h4><ol><li>Javadocs were mistakenly counted for attributes as well.
   This bug has been crept in with the last version.
</li><li>In some rare circumstances -recursive gave out a wrong
   "File not found" error message, thought it still processed
   all files correctly.
</li><li>"File not found" error message was only presented for the
   last missing file and not for all of them.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=16.34></A>Version 16.34</H3>
         Version 16.34 has been released on April 7, 2002<p>Recursive feature, support of JDK 1.4 assert statements.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>Paako Hannu provided code to recursively parse all Java files 
   including those in subdirectories.
</li><li>JavaNCSS supports now JDK 1.4 assert statements. At the same
   time methods or variables of name 'assert' are still parsed
   successfully, JavaNCSS is just not able to accept a field of
   type 'assert' anymore.
</li><li>John Wilson provided code to use "\r\n" on Windows to end 
   lines for JavaNCSS's ascii output. You might be able to turn
   this behavior off by overwriting the line.separator system 
   property when invoking the Java virtual machine.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=15.32></A>Version 15.32</H3>
         Version 15.32 has been released on November 21, 2001<p>New -out option.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>New option -out to specify output file. By default std out is
   used. Patch was supplied by Ted Leung.
</li><li>An Ant task for JavaNCSS has been published by Steve Jernigan 
   at http://sourceforge.net/projects/javancss2ant/.
</li><li>A basic Ant build.xml file gets distributed together with
   JavaNCSS. This file should be fine to compile the Java source
   files, but is not enough to create the jar file nor
   to compile the grammar with JavaCC.
</li></ol><h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>When relative files are given JavaNCSS will now take the 
   user.dir property in account to locate a file.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=14.31></A>Version 14.31</H3>
         Version 14.31 has been released on June 16, 2001<p>Major XML format bug fix.
<h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>XML format for object section was not well formed
   (missed closing objects tag).
</li><li>Missing newline after total printout of ncss.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=13.30></A>Version 13.30</H3>
         Version 13.30 has been released on June 14, 2001<p>Optional xml output.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>Output in xml format of collected data. Use option -xml
   (and recommended -all) at the command line and the metric
   results will be formatted in xml for further processing
   with xslt (e.g. to create a web page) or for importing in
   other applicatons. A dtd is distributed as well.
</li></ol><h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>Added 'strictfp' keyword to Java grammar.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=12.27></A>Version 12.27</H3>
         Version 12.27 has been released on March 27, 2001<p>Minor bug fix release.
<h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>Failure to parse 'this( name, o, (String)null, array );'
   as the first statement in a constructor.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=11.26></A>Version 11.26</H3>
         Version 11.26 has been released on March 23, 2001<p>Minor bug fix release.
<h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>Failure to parse 'this.var = x;' as the first statement in
   a constructor.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=10.25></A>Version 10.25</H3>
         Version 10.25 has been released on March 21, 2001<p>Minor improvements.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>JAVANCSS_HOME in javancss.bat is now set automaticly.
</li><li>'-check' option to trigger self tests from command line.
</li></ol><h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>'super((InputStream)null,null)' gets parsed successfully
   now.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=9.24></A>Version 9.24</H3>
         Version 9.24 has been released on October 4, 2000<p>Fixed a small Java parser bug.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>No new features.
</li></ol><h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>Fixed a small Java parser bug reported by Ramon Felciano.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=8.23></A>Version 8.23</H3>
         Version 8.23 has been released on July 1, 2000<p>Javadoc comments for methods are now counted.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>Javadoc comments for methods are now counted. The output
   for functions has a metric JVDC, which indicates if this
   method is formally documented or not.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=7.21></A>Version 7.21</H3>
         Version 7.21 has been released on January 31, 2000<p>Published now under the GNU General Public License.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>Javancss is now distributed under the GNU General Public

</li><li>&lt;EOF> at the end of a one line comment ('//') will be
   accepted now.
</li><li>Empty statements that javac accepts but are not allowed
   according to the Java Language Specification are now parsed
   without exception.
</li><li>Parse error messages were sometimes not very meaningful.
   This was a bug, not a missing feature.
</li><li>'-gui' command line option was implemented but not displayed
   with '-help' command.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=4.10></A>Version 4.10</H3>
         Version 4.10 has been released on March 8, 1998<p>Just a minor bug fix version.
<h4>Bugs Fixed</h4><ol><li>Swing and AWT components where mixed which resulted in some
   small layout problems. The GUI frontend is now tested with
   Swing 1.0.1.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=3.9></A>Version 3.9</H3>
         Version 3.9 has been released on February 17, 1998<p>New is a GUI frontend. Additionally the project manager Jacob
(<a href="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/jacob/">http://www.kclee.com/clemens/jacob/</a>) now includes the full
functionality of JavaNCSS, which makes selecting Java source
files much more convenient.
<h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>New '-gui' option, which is equivalent to '-all' and
   presents the output in it's <a href="gui.html">own window</a> instead of &lt;stdout>.
</li><li>You need swing in order to get this new feature working,
   though command line mode still works without it.
</li><li>New Jacob feature: a file with absolute file names of all 
   Java source files for the current project gets generated 
   when creating a new makefile. Its name is the project name
   plus '.srcfiles.txt' as postfix and will be located in
   the current project directory. This file can be further
   used by JavaNCSS in batch mode.
</li><li>The above feature can be used from the command line when
   specifying an '@' char in front of its file name. Then
   JavaNCSS interprets each line of its contents as the name of
   a java source file that should be counted. This also works
   recursively and normal source file names can be 
   intertwined with '@' files as well.
</li><li>New Jacob feature: 'NoEmacs' flag for Jacob's
   initialisation file and '-noemacs' startup option for use 
   without an editor. This feature is planned solely for 
   JavaNCSS users who don't want to use Jacob for programming 
   purposes.
</li></ol><h4>Fixed Bugs</h4><ol><li>Methods of anonymous classes are now presented with its
   class information.
</li></ol><H3><A NAME=2.4></A>Version 2.4</H3>
         Version 2.4 has been released on January 24, 1998<p><h4>What's New</h4><ol><li>New '-package' option. 
</li><li>When &lt;stdin> is used for input and a parse error occurs the
   last class and method successfully parsed is given together
   with the error message. Note, that errors in package or 
   import statements or not captured this way. 
</li><li>More documentation about what is "exactly" measured. 
</li><li>The grammar is now slightly more tolerant, but still not as
   tolerant as Sun's javac compiler. I made javancss just as 
   tolerant as necessary to parse Sun's original java.* source
   files. 
</li><li>Different options can be specified and all get executed, 
   therefor only one run is needed for different output 
   formats. 
</li><li>New '-all' option is equivalent to '-package -object
   -function'.

   shouldn't.

Mike Clark's JDepend
"traverses a set of Java source file directories and generates design quality metrics for each Java package.
JDepend allows you to automatically measure the quality of a design in terms of its extensibility,
reusability, and maintainability to effectively manage and
control package dependencies."<p>
While JavaNCSS simply lets you know how much source code
you have to deal with (ncss metric), JDepend informs you
about the package structure of your code and helps you 
spotting weaknesses in your global code organization,
e.g. identifying dependency cycles, creating a few independent
packages on which most other package rely on, etc.<p/>

You can use JDepend as a quantitative
measurement tool as well.

Linux distribution. It runs on Linux, Windows, and hopefully
on other systems too. To run on Windows, you have to install
Cygwin first.
