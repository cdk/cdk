<h3>The Drawing Buttons</h3><br>
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The drawing button <img src="../../small-bin/bond.gif"></li>
   </ul>
     <p>Puts JChemapint in the draw mode, which is the standard mode in which 
     build up chemical structures. If selected you can click on a point on 
     the document and you'll create a single atom at this point. If you click, 
     hold and drag the mouse, a bond is created. Multiple clicking on an 
     existing bond will cycle its bond order between the values 1, 2 and 3.</p>
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
   
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The up-bond button <img src="../../small-bin/up_bond.gif"></li>
   </ul>
     <p>This mode enables you to change an existing bond into a filled
     wedge - the standard stereo bond desribing that the atom at the thick 
     end is above the 2D plane in which your are supposed to imagine the atom 
     at the thin end. Further, if selected, multiple clicking on an existing 
     bond will change it to a filled wedge and if it already has this shape 
     it will toggle between the two possible orientations</p>.
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The down-bond button <img src="../../small-bin/down_bond.gif"></li>
   </ul>
     <p>This mode enables you to change an existing bond into a dashed 
     wedge - the standard stereo bond describing that the atom at the thin end
     is below the 2D plane in which your are supposed to imagine the atom at 
     the thick end. Further, if selected, multiple clicking on an existing 
     bond will change it to a dashed wedge and if it already has this shape it 
     will toggle between the two possible orientations.</p>
     </p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The Ring templates</li>
   </ul>
     <p>The ring templates, like, <img src="../../small-bin/triangle.gif">,
     <img src="../../small-bin/pentagon.gif">,  <img src="../../small-bin/hexagon.gif">, 
     allow you to draw single 
     rings and complex ringsystems from a few predefined templates.</p>
     <p>A click on an atom places the preselected ring such that the atoms 
     on which you clicked is one of the ring atoms. Click on a bond and it 
     will be part of the newly created ring. A new ring is always placed 
     on the least hindered side of the system. If you don't like the result, 
     you can click on a bond, hold the mouse button and use the appearing 
     gray line to indicate side of the bond on which you want to have the 
     ring placed. Atoms of the newly place ring that are within the snap 
     radius of existing atoms will be fused with these.</p>
     </p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
