<h2>Finding and Reporting bugs</h2>
<p> Though JChemPaint already is very usefull, it is not without errors.
    The development team is too small to make the source code 100% bugless. 
    So, at some stage you will find bugs (apologies for that on beforehand). 
    However, the open source community is known for quick response in both 
    acknowledging the bug,  and  fixing the bug. The JChemPaint team provides 
    the same standards which is sometimes a bit difficult because there is 
    so much to do. Nevertheless, we appreciate it very much if bugs got reported; 
    the JChemPaint team  does  solve many bugs in each next release.</p>

<h3> Starting JChemPaint to get debug information </h3>
<p>Debugging is a lot easier when debug information is supplied along with 
   the bug report. JChemPaint can be started to get debug information like this:</p>
   <pre> java -Dcdk.debugging=true -jar jchempaint.jar</pre>
<p>This will create a cdk.log file which can be attached to the bug.</p>
