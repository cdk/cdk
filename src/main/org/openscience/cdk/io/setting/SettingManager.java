/**
 * Provides dynamic management of settings. This
 * was created with the intention of managing {@see IOSetting}'s for {@see IChemObjectIO}
 * however it could be recycled for other purposes where dynamic settings are required.
 * Settings are stored in a {@see Map} using the name of the setting as the key. The name is
 * normalised (lowercase and whitespace removal) to allow 'fuzzy' setting access. This means
 * that character case differences do not affect the retrieval of objects.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // create the manager and add a setting
 * SettingManager<IOSetting>   manager = new SettingManager<IOSetting>();
 * manager.add(new BooleanIOSetting("Sample", IOSetting.MEDIUM, "This is a sample?", "true"));
 *
 * // check the setting is present (case insensitive
 * if(manager.has("sample")) {
 *
 *      // access requiring multiple lines of code
 *      BooleanIOSetting setting = manager.get("sample");
 *      String           v1      = setting.getSetting();
 *
 *      // single line access (useful for conditional statements)
 *      String v2 = manager.get("sample", BooleanIOSetting.class).getSetting();
 *
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of setting that will be managed (e.g. IOSetting).
