/**
 * Compute all simple cycles (rings) in a graph. Generally speaking one does not
 * need all the cycles and tractable subsets offer good alternatives.
 *
 * <ul> <li>EdgeShortCycles - the smallest cycle through each edge</li>
 * <li>{@link RelevantCycles} - union of all minimum cycle bases - unique but
 * may be exponential</li> <li>{@link EssentialCycles} - intersection of all
 * minimum cycle bases </li> <li>{@link MinimumCycleBasis} - a minimum cycles
 * basis, may not be unique. Often used interchangeable with the term SSSR.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * For maximum performance the algorithm should be run only on ring systems (a
 * biconnected component with at least one tri-connected vertex). An example of
 * this is shown below:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * // convert the molecule to adjacency list - may be redundant in future
 * IAtomContainer m =...;
 * int[][] g = GraphUtil.toAdjList(m);
 *
 * // efficient computation/partitioning of the ring systems
 * RingSearch rs = new RingSearch(m, g);
 *
 * // isolated cycles don't need to be run
 * rs.isolated();
 *
 * // process fused systems separately
 * for (int[] fused : rs.fused()) {
 *     // given the fused subgraph, max cycle size is
 *     // the number of vertices
 *     AllCycles ac = new AllCycles(subgraph(g, fused),
 *                                  fused.length,
 *                                  maxDegree);
 *    // cyclic walks
 *    int[][] paths = ac.paths();
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
