/**
 * Useful for logging messages. Often used as a class static variable
 * instantiated like (see {@link LoggingToolFactory}):
 * <pre>
 * public class SomeClass {
 *   private static ILoggingTool logger;
 *
 *   static {
 *     logger = LoggingToolFactory.createLoggingTool(SomeClass.class);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * There is no special reason not to make the logger private and static, as the
 * logging information is closely bound to one specific Class, not subclasses
 * and not instances.
 *
 * <p>The logger has five logging levels:
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>DEBUG
 *  <dd>Default mode. Used for information you might need to track down the
 *      cause of a bug in the source code, or to understand how an algorithm
 *      works.
 *  <dt>WARNING
 *  <dd>This indicates a special situation which is unlike to happen, but for
 *      which no special actions need to be taken. E.g. missing information in
 *      files, or an unknown atom type. The action is normally something user
 *      friendly.
 *  <dt>INFO
 *  <dd>For reporting informative information to the user that he might easily
 *      disregard. Real important information should be given to the user using
 *      a GUI element.
 *  <dt>FATAL
 *  <dd>This level is used for situations that should not have happened *and*
 *      that lead to a situation where this program can no longer function
 *      (rare in Java).
 *  <dt>ERROR
 *  <dd>This level is used for situations that should not have happened *and*
 *      thus indicate a bug.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>Consider that the debugging will not always be turned on. Therefore, it is
 * better not to concatenate string in the logger.debug() call, but have the
 * ILoggingTool do this when appropriate. In other words, use:
 * <pre>
 * logger.debug("The String X has this value: ", someString);
 * logger.debug("The int Y has this value: ", y);
 * </pre>
 * instead of:
 * <pre>
 * logger.debug("The String X has this value: " + someString);
 * logger.debug("The int Y has this value: " + y);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For logging calls that require even more computation you can use the
 * <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method:
 * <pre>
 * if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
 *   logger.info("The 1056389822th prime that is used is: ",
 *     calculatePrime(1056389822));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to the methods specific in the interfance, implementations
 * must also implement the static method {@code create(Class<?>)} which
 * can be used by the {@link LoggingToolFactory} to instantiate the
 * implementation.
