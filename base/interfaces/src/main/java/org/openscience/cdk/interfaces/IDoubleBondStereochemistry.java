/**
 * Stereochemistry specification for double bond stereochemistry. The data model defines the double
 * atoms and two ligands attached to those two atoms, linearly connected with the double bond in the
 * middle. The {@link IBond}s that define the stereo element are defined as an array where the bonds
 * are sorted according to the linear connectivity. Thus, the first and third bonds are the two
 * bonds attached on either side of the double bond, and the second bond is the double bond. The
 * stereo annotation then indicates if the ligand atoms are in the cis position ({@link
 * Conformation#TOGETHER}) or in the trans position ({@link Conformation#OPPOSITE}), matching the
 * orientation of the methyls in but-2-ene respectively as <i>Z</i> and <i>E</i>.
