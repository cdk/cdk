/**
 * Electron donation model closely mirroring the Daylight model for use in
 * generating SMILES. The model was interpreted from various resources and as
 * such may not match exactly. If you find an inconsistency please add a request
 * for enhancement to the patch tracker. One known limitation is that this model
 * does not currently consider unknown/pseudo atoms '*'. <p/>
 *
 * The model makes a couple of assumptions which it will not correct for.
 * Checked assumptions cause the model to throw a runtime exception. <ul>
 * <li>there should be no valence errors (unchecked)</li> <li>every atom has a
 * set implicit hydrogen count (checked)</li> <li>every bond has defined order,
 * single, double etc (checked)</li> <li>atomic number of non-pseudo atoms is
 * set (checked)</li> </ul> <p/>
 *
 * The aromaticity model in SMILES was designed to simplify canonicalisation and
 * express symmetry in a molecule. The contributed electrons can be summarised
 * as follows (refer to code for exact specification): <ul> <li>carbon,
 * nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, arsenic and selenium are allow to be
 * aromatic</li> <li>atoms should be Sp2 hybridised - not actually computed</li>
 * <li>atoms adjacent to a single cyclic pi bond contribute 1 electron</li>
 * <li>neutral or negatively charged atoms with a lone pair contribute 2
 * electrons</li> <li>exocyclic pi bonds are allowed but if the exocyclic atom
 * is more electronegative it consumes an electron. As an example ketone groups
 * contribute '0' electrons.</li></ul>
