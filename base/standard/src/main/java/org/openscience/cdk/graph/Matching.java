 * A matching is an independent edge set of a graph. This is a set of edges that
 * share no common vertices. A matching is perfect if every vertex in the graph
 * is matched. Each vertex can be matched with exactly one other vertex.<p/>
 *
 * This class provides storage and manipulation of a matching. A new match is
 * added with {@link #match(int, int)}, any existing match for the newly matched
 * vertices is no-longer available. The status of a vertex can be queried with
 * {@link #matched(int)} and the matched vertex obtained with {@link
 * #other(int)}. <p/>
