/**
 * A configurable model to perceive aromatic systems. Aromaticity is useful as
 * both a chemical property indicating stronger stabilisation and as a way to
 * treat different resonance forms as equivalent. Each has its own implications
 * the first in physicochemical attributes and the second in similarity,
 * depiction and storage.
 * <p/>
 * To address the resonance forms, several simplified (sometimes conflicting)
 * models have arisen. Generally the models <b>loosely</b> follow
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel's_rule">Hückel's rule</a>
 * for determining aromaticity. A common omission being that planarity is not
 * tested and chemical compounds which are non-planar can be perceived
 * as aromatic. An example of one such compound is, cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene.
 * <p/>
 * Although there is not a single universally accepted model there are models
 * which may better suited for a specific use (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NextMoveSoftware/cheminformatics-toolkits-a-personal-perspective">Cheminformatics Toolkits: A Personal Perspective, Roger Sayle</a>).
 * The different models are often ill-defined or unpublished but it is important
 * to acknowledge that there are differences (see. <a href="http://blueobelisk.shapado.com/questions/aromaticity-perception-differences">Aromaticity Perception Differences, Blue Obelisk</a>).
 * <p/>
 * Although models may get more complicated (e.g. considering tautomers)
 * normally the reasons for differences are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the atoms allowed and how many electrons each contributes</li>
 *     <li>the rings/cycles are tested</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * This implementation allows configuration of these via an {@link
 * ElectronDonation} model and {@link CycleFinder}. To obtain an instance
 * of the electron donation model use one of the factory methods,
 * {@link ElectronDonation#cdk()}, {@link ElectronDonation#cdkAllowingExocyclic()},
 * {@link ElectronDonation#daylight()} or {@link ElectronDonation#piBonds()}.
