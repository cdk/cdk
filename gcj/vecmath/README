This is unofficial free implementation(source code release) of Java(TM) 3D
API 1.2 Beta1 vecmath package.

This package supports vector/point transformation math often utilized in
computer graphics.

The Included classes are the followings.

    * Tuples

      Tuple2f       Tuple2d    Tuple3b        Tuple3d      Tuple3f     
        |             |          |              |            |
        +Vector2f     +Vector2d	 +Color3b       +Vector3d    +Point3f   
        +Point2f      +Point2d			+Point3d     +Vector3f  
        +TexCoord2f 					     +Color3f
						             +TexCoord3f

      Tuple4b       Tuple4d        Tuple4f     Tuple3i     Tuple4i
        |             |              |           |           |
        +Color4b      +Vector4d      +Color4f    + Point3i   + Point4i
                      +Point4d       +Point4f
                      +Quat4d        +Vector4f
                                     +Quat4f  

      AxisAngle4d   AxisAngle4f    GVector

    * Matrices

      Matrix3d      Matrix4d      Matrix3f     Matrix4f  GMatrix

    * Exceptions

      MismatchedSizeException   SingularMatrixException

Generic matrices' LU and SV decomposition are also there.
You can download the zipped, tar+gzipped or jar'ed *.java source code
from;

       http://www.esm.co.jp/divisions/open-sys/java/vecmath/

I implemented my version from scatch and reviewed it with the version of Paul Bathen,
Kevin Copps, and Rick Niles from Adm King's unofficial j3d implementation.

The features are;
 * FULL 1.2 specification is implemented. All the classes and methods are there.
 * Has a test suite class named VecmathTest with a main method.
 * No 'new' operator at all except for GMatrix, GVecator and error exceptions.
 * Aliasing-safe. i.e. v.cross(v,v1) or m.mul(m1,m) works.

Any bug reports or comments are welcome.

Note, there is a parallel C++ version.
